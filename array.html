    <li>What is an array in JS?</li>
    <p>An array is a type of object which holds a group of values.</p>
    <li>In your own words, why do we use arrays in Javascript?</li>
    <p>Arrays make it easier to store, sort, and find specific values in a list.</p>
    <li>When should we use an array?</li>
    <p>An array should be used whenever there is a large group of values that we might want to access both individually and as a group. </p>
    <li>What are 3 kinds of array methods, and how do we use them?</li>
    <p>Three types of array methods are .push(), .pop(), and .splice()
        <br>
        .push() is used to add one or more elements to the end of an array.
        <br>
        .pop() is used to remove the last element of an array and return that element. This modifies the original array.
        <br>
        .splice() is a way to remove any element in an array without changing the original array.
    </p>
    <li>What are two examples of higher order Array methods?</li>
    <p>Two higher order array methods are .map(), which creates a new array with elements that meet the conditions of the function calling said elements,
        , and .sort(), which does exactly what it sounds like it would do: it sorts elements in an array.
    </p>
   </ul>
