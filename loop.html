        <li> What is a loop?</li>
        <p>A loop is a block of code that is executed multiple times</p>
        <br>
        <li>In your own words, why do we use loops in Javascirpt?</li>
        <p>We use loops whenever we want to automatically go through a block of code multiple times with different values used each time said block of code is read through. </p>
        <br>
        <li>In your own words, when should we use a certain loop?</li>
        <p>A for loop should be used when we want to loop through a block of code with no specified conditions.
           A while loop is used if we want to only run through a block of code when the set conditions are met/true
           A do while is the same thing as a while loop, except the code will stop running once the conditions are true.
